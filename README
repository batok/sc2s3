A program to take and store screenshots in Amazon Web Services S3

Description:

A multiplatform desktop (GUI) program to take screenshots and upload them to Amazon's S3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to add s3accounts.py in the same directory as the script.

s3accounts.py only needs a line like this.

accounts = dict ( whateveryoucallanaccount = ["amazon public string", "amazon private string"]

This program can also run a wsgi web server at port 8000.
To make this happen you only need to add a second line to yoour s3accounts.py

preferred_bucket = "thenameofabucketofyours"

If you want to manage more than one s3 account use following to set an account as default
preferred_account = "whateveryoucallanaccountthatsgoingtobedefault"

The purpose of the web server is to allow taking a snapshot from another computer ( or
the same computer with the url http://localhost:8000/click )

Also you can take a screenshot series.  By doing this, the program will generate also 
an html page and will upload it to s3 besides all screenshots. 

Every time a screenshot is done , sc2s3 will also upload a thumbnail of the screenshot.

If PIL ( Pyrhon Image Library ) is detected, will generate also a jpg file that will upload to s3.

By selecting and right clicking on a row in the list of uploaded files you will get additional options.
One of these additional options is to shorten the amazon url with bit.ly .  To do that you need an account in bit.ly
and you need also to add two more lines to s3accounts.py :

bitly_login = "yourloginnameonbitly"
bitly_apikey = "yourapikey"

Now you have menu and context options to upload any file you want in private or public-read mode.

If you are in Mac OS X and have the Growl module installed ( it is included in the bindings python section of growl SDK ) 
sc2s3 will notify to growl when the screenshot is uploaded to s3 instead of the normal modal message box.

I've found this program useful to share screenshots with others in chat systems and
social networks. The wsgi ( python's idea of modern web server ) option let you fire a screenshot from another computer
using a simple browser  or language or commands like curl and wget.

If you have PIL ( Image Library ) it will be used to generate a screenshot in jpeg format besides png default.
