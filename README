A wxpython program to store screenshots in Amazon Web Services S3

Description:

A multiplatform desktop program to take screenshots and upload them to Amazon's S3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to add s3accounts.py in the same directory as the script.

s3accounts.py only needs a line like this.

accounts = dict ( whateveryoucallanaccount = ["amazon public string", "amazon private string"]

This program can also run a wsgi web server at port 8000.
To make this happen you only need to add a second line to yoour s3accounts.py

preferred_bucket = "thenameofabucketofyours"

The purpose of the web server is to allow taking a snapshot from another computer ( or
the same computer with the url http://localhost:8000/click )

Also you can take a screenshot series.  By doing this, the program will generate also 
an html page and will upload it to s3 besides all screenshots. 

Every time a screnshot is taken , sc2s3 will also upload a thumbnail of the screenshot.

If PIL ( Image Library is detected ) will generate also a jpg file that will upload to s3.

By selecting and right clicking on a row in the list of uploaded files you will get additional options.
One of these additional options is to shorten the amazon url with bit.ly .  To do that you need an account in bit.ly
and you need also to add two more lines to s3accounts.py :

bitly_login = "yourloginnameonbitly"
bitly_apikey = "yourapikey"

I've found this program useful to share screenshots with others in chat systems and
social networks. The wsgi ( web server option let you fire a screnshot from another computer using a simple browser ).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
