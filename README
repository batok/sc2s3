A program to take screenshots from your computer ( Windows , Mac or Linux )  and store them in Amazon Web Services S3

Description:

A multiplatform desktop (GUI) program to take screenshots and upload them to Amazon's S3.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you need an S3 account in Amazon Web Services.  If you don't know what S3 is, go to http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

Second, create a bucket ( kind of filesystem directory  ) in S3's terminology.  

You need to create the s3accounts.py file in the same directory as the sc2s3.py script file.  You can use any text editor to do so.

s3accounts.py only at least needs a line like this:

accounts = dict ( whatever_you_call_an_account = ["amazon public string", "amazon private string"] )

This program is not only a GUI front end to take and upload screenshots.  Includes also a webserver.

To activate the "wsgi" web server at a specified at run time port ( 8000 is the default ), and a second line to s3accounts.py file:

preferred_bucket = "thenameofabucketofyours"

You can use more the one S3 accounts with this program.

If so instead of the first line, use one similar to this:
accounts = dict ( whatever_you_call_the_first_account = ["amazon public string of first account", "amazon private string of first account"], whatever_you_call_the_second_account = ["amazon public string of second account", "amazon private string of second account"] ) )


If you want to manage more than one S3 accounts add the following to set an account as default

preferred_account = "whatever_you_call_an_account_thats_going_to_be_default"

The purpose of the "embedded" web server is to allow taking a snapshot from another computer ( or
the same computer with the url http://localhost:8000/click if in the same computer or http://ipaddressoftherunningcomputer:8000/click ) ( 8000 if default was chosen )

Also you can take a screenshot series.  By doing this, the program will generate also 
an index html page to link every screenshot and will upload it to s3 besides all screenshots. 

Every time a screenshot is done , sc2s3 will also upload a thumbnail of the screenshot.

If PIL ( Pyrhon Image Library ) is detected , will generate also a jpg file that will upload to s3.

By selecting and right clicking on a row in the list of uploaded files you will get a lot of additional options.

One of these additional options is to shorten the amazon url with bit.ly .  To do that you need an account in bit.ly
and you need also to add two more lines to s3accounts.py :

bitly_login = "your_login_name_on_bit_ly"
bitly_apikey = "yourapikey"

Also you'll have "right click or context" options to upload any file you want in private or public-read mode.  Not only the screenshots.

You'll have also an option to take a timed screenshot and upload it to s3 asynchronously also.  That is, in a separate thread without blocking the GUI.

If you are in Mac OS X and have the Growl module installed ( it is included in the bindings python section of growl SDK ) 
sc2s3 will notify to growl when the screenshot is uploaded to s3 instead of the normal modal message box.

Now you can tweet a message with enshorten by bit.ly link of your screenshot.  This function is available if:

You have the following lines in s3accounts.py....

twitter_user = "your twitter username"
twitter_password = "your twitter password"
twitter_message ="The text that precedes the link"  i.e. "Here is my screenshot"

Also you need to download the python module twyt module from http://andrewprice.me.uk/projects/twyt/download/ 

Choose the most up to date tar.gz file that you have to unpack and procede to do the normal python installation , the distutils way ( python setup.py install )

The tweet feature is only available for Async Upload from the Screenshot Menu.

If you include in s3accounts a line with...

message = "whatever you want to appear as text blended with your image"

the message will be mixed with the screenshot and will appear in the upper left corner.

If you have a gravatar account, and want your image to appear in your screenshots include a line in s3accounts.py with ...

gravatar = "your mail goes here ( i.e. averagejoe@lookmanohands.com )"

By doing this your gravatar default image will appear in the upper left corner of your screnshots.

I've found this program useful to share screenshots with others in chat systems and
social networks. The wsgi ( python's idea of modern web server ) option let you fire a screenshot from another computer
using a simple browser  or language or commands like curl or wget.
